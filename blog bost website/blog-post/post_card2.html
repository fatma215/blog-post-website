            <p >An Egyptian food producer is planning to expand into European markets on the back of a significant rise in US sales.</p>
            <p > City Farm, a frozen fruits and vegetables processor, intends to open representative offices in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands first.</p>
            <p > CEO Mahmoud Lamei said the plan followed “remarkable success” in the United States and the European drive would begin in markets with large Arab communities.</p>
            <p > City Farm’s sales in the US have increased from $28 million in 2021 to about $50 million last year. New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Florida, Texas and Michigan are its biggest markets.</p>
            <p > Egypt’s Agricultural Export Council reported that exports to Europe grew by 81 percent during the 2022-23 season.</p>
            <img src="../imges/vege3.jpg" alt="page not found" >
            <p > Lamei said City Farm was expecting its global sales to increase by about 30 percent as a result of the European expansion. </p>
            <p>It exports about 1,300 tonnes of produce per year via the ports of Alexandria and Damietta.</p>
            <p>Egypt’s exports of crops to European Union countries reached 1.4 million tonnes in 2022-23, compared to 777,000 tonnes in the previous season, according to the Agricultural Export Council.</p>
            <p>The value of those exports rose by 42 percent to $917 million. EU countries accounted for 25 percent of global Egyptian food exports.</p>
            <p>Citrus fruits were most popular with a value of $211 million through the export of 491,000 tonnes. Next were potatoes (394,000 tonnes at $166 million) and onions (128,000 tonnes at $64 million).</p>
            <p>The Netherlands is Egypt’s No 1 customer in the EU, followed by Italy, Greece and Spain.</p>
            <p>Agriculture accounts for 11 percent of GDP and employs one in four people, according to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>
